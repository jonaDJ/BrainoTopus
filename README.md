# BrainoTopus

BrainoTopus is a rainy-day puzzle hub with a clean daily-game layout inspired by NYT-style play. Wordle is live now, and more games are planned. The UI uses a cloudy sticky header and a rain-on-glass overlay, with octopus-themed branding across the app.

## What this app is

- Weather/theme: rain overlay + clouded sticky header for a stormy look.
- Mascot/style: octopus icon + playful copy ("Be Dumb. Be Octopus.").
- Games: NYT-style daily puzzle experience, starting with Wordle.

## NYT games question

No, this is not a direct NYT clone.  
It borrows the daily puzzle format and clean layout pattern, then applies BrainoTopus theme, branding, and custom implementation.

## Current game status

- Wordle: live
- Connections: developing
- Mini Crossword: developing
